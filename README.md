## My process

### Built with

- Sass
- Pug

### What I learned

I learned how to validate an email input and modify css properties through JavaScript.

### Continued development

In this project, I feel very confident with my HTLM and CSS skills, but I had a hard time using JavaScript. I have to focus more on the programming language.
